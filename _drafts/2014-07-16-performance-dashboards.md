## Takeaways

The nature of the workshop sessions meant that I had plenty of questions to take away that weren't necessarily questions that could be answered, tehy were just things to explore;

### Concessionary Travel [John Pattern]()

John took us through some of the data Cambridgeshire County Council have put together for a dashboard on concessionary travel renewal in the county. John show us data on volume, digital vs non-digital split and customer segmentation over time which yeilded some interesting results. The dashboard enabled us to see the data in a very simple format but more importantly it asked alot of questions for the next steps but one question struck me as particularly interesing:

Tracking trends within one transaction is excellent but can we use that data to link transactions across life events? In effect, if we see one customer segment require a service less often, can we use that insight to learn how to better support those customers in finding the next service they're likely to need.

### Library book renewals [Kate Sahota](https://www.twitter.com/808kate)

* library books by renewal item vs fixed time
* does the cost of the fine admin outweigh the income for the fines
* top transactions iteration vs minor transactions experience


### Other questions raised

* digital vs non-digital what's the definition
* cost per transaction, is it a fair measurment?
