### Needs

One of the things that dashboards give you is the ablity to see trends over time. The idea that you can visualise trends and make choices based on what the data is telling you is really valuable. Another side to this is the retrospective; what happens when we make a change based on the trend and then that trend changes as a result? How do we remember what that change was so that it can be matched up with the impact it made?

As part of the performance platform I'd like the ability to 'tag' changes so that when I make a change I can see in the retrospect how it affected the trend.

On a couple of the example dashboards [Matt]() showed, there was a page load time graph. At one point the Carers Allowance dashboard showed a dramatic drop in page load time almost overnight, which says that there was a significant change made. Retrospectively will people rememeber what that change was? In that case they probably will because the change would have been logged in the code for the Carers Allowance process, however,what if changes are made to the service delivery outside of the digital service? 

Tagging changes where real-world events occur I believe would be a huge asset, like a diary of tagged descriptions to explain possible changes in trend.

#### Service Log // show performance platform graph with tags?
* 1st July 2014 | Tag: Launch of the revised payment schedule letters
* "There's been a dramatic drop in phone calls about housing benefit payments" | 
* "The number of missed bins being reported is increasing" | Tag: 3 bin lorries off the run
* "There's a downward trend in library book renewals" | Tag: removed fines | Tag: extended renewals from 4 weeks to 8 weeks | Tag: Amazon unlimited launched

This may offer too much of an assumption about the trend up front but in practice I think you'd be tagging service events as you went, without knowledge of the trend itself. It's only when you look at the emerging trends alongside the tags that you may or may not see some correlation. Service event tags could help support learning too, when an event occurs or a change is made you'd very quickly be able to see the impact, if any, of that change. Dashboards can help to give a real-time view of your service and if you're making decisions based on that data it'd be great to know that the trend you're seeing is a natural trend that needs deeper analysis or if it could be the result of a specific service event.

This wouldn't be easy to maintain and I haven't thought about how much value it would give, equally it may not be appropriate to include in the dashboard itself but it could be a great addtion to the platform. It's an idea.
