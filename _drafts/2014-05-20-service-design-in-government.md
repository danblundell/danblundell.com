The 19th and 20th May 2014 were two days I'd looked forward to for a while. Service Design in Government conference was pegged to be a bit more than your regular conference. With a focussed agenda of talks and workshops it was something a little bit different and a welcome break from my current workload. It was so useful, I thought I'd write up a short(ish!) review of some of the sessions I attended.

### Inside, outside and on the edge of design in Government<span class="h__support"><strong>Sarah Drummond</strong> _(We Are Snook)_</span>

Before the conference I'll admit I'd not heard of Sarah or [her company](http://wearesnook.com/snook/) but it's safe to say that her opening Keynote was absolutely brilliant and won me over immediately.

Sarah talked about her background in design and how her interest in product design was able to both complement and fuel her work in service design. Sarah took us through various case studies ranging from [myPolice](http://www.mypolice.org/) to policy making, the post office and XXX.

It was clear that Sarah's passion for good design isn't limited to services or products but stretches far beyond answering simple questions of aesthetic, a real designer. The introduction of what turned out to be the days themes were welcomed by the room, "it's about people," "design with empathy" and "make it human" were all key parts of a keynote crammed full of insight and experience.

Thanks Sarah, I can't think of a better way to kick off.

### An introduction to documenting the User Journey <span class="h__support"><strong>Clara Teoh and Hua Zheong</strong> (GDS and Webcredible)</span>

The kid that wanted to make things out of paper and glue couldn't resist a workshop session in a day otherwise rammed with talks so I headed over to the second room where Clara and Hua were hosting a workshop that promised to give us an introduction to documenting user journeys.

The room was full of fresh faces and eager eyes waiting to be whisked through the fundamentals of putting user journeys down on paper and we weren't disappointed.

Clara and Hua did a tag-team introduction of case studies across a range of examples from very detailed service blueprints to crude scribblings from torn up notebooks. The range of examples gave a quick but informative overview of how to adapt your output to the purpose and audience you're delivering to.

Very quickly we moved on to the actual doing, personally I thought this was great; getting people to introduce themselves on the fly as we broke out into groups, picked the journey we were going to document and chose the audience that we'd be delivering to. The workshop was swiftly moved on to conducting 5 minute user interviews across the different teams, then gathering and analysing the feedback all within 20 minutes. Of course it wasn't the level of detail or quality that you'd want to deliver in the real world but it was a fantastic way to get hands on and go through the motions of doing the research and beginning the documentation.

For the following 20-30 minutes we fell back into our groups, collated our findings and decided on the main points we were going to demonstrate to our audience using our user journey document. Finally it was post-its, paper and pens gone wild - getting the user journey down on paper demonstrating the users emotions based on our research, explaining their expectations and feelings throughout the journey as well as pulling out the opportunities for the organisation to improve things.

To wrap up we had 2/3 minutes to present our user journeys to the rest of the group and discuss our findings.

It was a short but sweet introduction to documenting the user journey but
