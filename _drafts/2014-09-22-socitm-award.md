## Innovation is: 
"...a new idea, device or process.[1] Innovation can be viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, inarticulated needs, or existing market needs.[2] This is accomplished through more effective products, processes, services, technologies, or ideas that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term innovation can be defined as something original and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society."

## Presentation ideas

56k modem sound

New generation of workers who've never heard a 56k modem

they've never lived without the internet

grew up with the internet

internet is full of lies / hoaxes and trickery

inheriant distrust breeds continual challenging of the facts in front of you

new generation question everything

asking questions leads to iteration (evolution) or innovation (revolution)

not asking questions leads to involution

government is distrusted because of cultural references (and reality, and politicians)
