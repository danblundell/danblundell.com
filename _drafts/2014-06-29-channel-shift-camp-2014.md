A while back I wrote a post about [my thoughts around channel shift]({{ site.url }}/2014/04/channel-shift/) and [Nick Hill](https://twitter.com/psfnick) was kind enough to share the post and asked me if I was coming to [Channel Shift Camp](), at the time I wasn't but I've been to events that Nick's arranged in the past and they've always been excellent so it didn't take much to convince me to sign up.

Channel Shift Camp is an unconference event, attendees are asked to share their ideas at the beginning of the day and by way of a whoop and a holla the rest of the attendees help form the sessions for the day. It's a great opportunity for everyone to get involved, get feedback on their ideas and form new connections with people they potentially wouldn't otherwise have met.

As was only fair in attending an unconference, I pitched a session on councils from scratch. An opportunity for people to forget the politics and limitations of their day-to-day and reimagine what service delivery would be like

Here's a few of the things discussed as part of our no-contraints session, it must be made clear that these were 'imagine if' sessions and were not by any means a voice of intent from attendees:

* _Housing:_ it's not just about houses, it's about communities; families, provisions, schools etc
* _Subscription services:_ pay for what you want, e.g if you're happy dealing with your waste, don't pay for a bin collection
* _Tiered service provision:_ provide for the less fortunate and vulnerable but remove services for the wealthy where they weren't required
* _Points based welfare system:_ instead of straight up financial support from the government, being able to select how you received your state support in terms of dividing up a number of 'points' between the things you wanted support with (Transport / Rent / Food etc)
